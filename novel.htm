<p>“Drrinnnggg!”</p>

<p>The sharp ring of the school bell sliced through the chatter, chairs screeching as students scrambled to settle down. Sunlight spilled through the tall windows, painting slanted lines across desks cluttered with books and half-finished notes.</p>

<p>Iri blinked, startled, her pen frozen mid-air. She hadn’t realized how long she’d been drifting away, thoughts wandering somewhere far from the noise of the classroom.</p>

<p>Beside her, Sani nudged her elbow lightly, a playful grin tugging at her lips as she stacked her notebooks.</p>

<p>“You were spacing out again, weren’t you? What’s got you so deep in thought this time?” she teased, already flipping open her book as if the answer could wait, though her curious eyes said otherwise.</p>

<p>“I’ve just… been thinking about a few things lately,” Iri admitted, forcing a faint laugh.</p>

<p>Sani chuckled softly and slipped an arm around her shoulder, lowering her voice into a playful whisper.</p>

<p>“Want to vent? I’ll be your therapist.”</p>

<p>Iri brushed her hand away, shaking her head.</p>

<p>“No, really. It’s nothing serious.”</p>

<p>Just then, the classroom door slid open and the teacher walked in, carrying the weight of silence with him. The noise quickly died down as students straightened in their seats.</p>

<p>Sani leaned closer again, smirking as her eyes darted toward an empty desk.</p>

<p>“Your boyfriend—Hiki, right? He’s late again.”</p>

<p>Iri turned to glance at the vacant seat, her lips curving into a small, knowing smile.</p>

<p>“Mm-hm.” She nodded quietly.</p>

<p>The teacher cleared his throat as he opened the lesson, chalk tapping against the board in steady rhythm. Students bent over their notebooks, pens scratching quietly.</p>

<p>Sani leaned closer, her voice low but laced with curiosity.</p>

<p>“I’ve always wondered why your boyfriend’s late so often,” she murmured, eyes still fixed on the front while her hand moved across the page. “Does he oversleep?”</p>

<p>She stole a quick glance at Iri.</p>

<p>Iri shook her head, whispering back, “No. He’s not the type to sleep in.”</p>

<p>The door slid open, pulling every gaze in the room toward it.</p>

<p>In an instant, Hiki became the center of attention. A few whispers rippled through the class.</p>

<p>“Why’s he late again?”</p>

<p>“Tch, same old Hiki…”</p>

<p>Hiki strolled in with unhurried steps, his face unreadable. Without a bow or even a glance at the teacher, he headed straight for his seat.</p>

<p>The teacher’s voice cut the silence. “I’ve already marked you absent. Is everything all right?”</p>

<p>Hiki dropped his bag onto the desk, not bothering to sit up straight.</p>

<p>“Whatever it is, it’s none of your business,” he said flatly, his tone almost careless. “I’m sure the principal already told you.”</p>

<p>The teacher’s fist clenched by his side, but after a sharp breath, he turned back to the board.</p>

<p>“Do as you want. Just remember—this isn’t because of you. It’s because the principal said so.”</p>

<p>Once again, Hiki stole the room’s attention. It wasn’t just stares this time—it was sharp, lingering curiosity, as if every student was silently asking what exactly he and the teacher had been talking about.</p>

<p>Chalk scratched against the blackboard, resuming the lesson, but the silence that hung in the room made one thing clear: nobody had stopped thinking about Hiki.</p>

<p>Sani nudged Iri with her elbow, her voice low like she didn’t want the others to overhear.</p>

<p>“Is he always like that? Feels like he’s hiding something. Do you know anything, Iri?”</p>

<p>Iri turned her face away, eyes back on the teacher.</p>

<p>“I don’t know why he acts that way toward the teacher, but I’m sure he has his reasons. As for whether it happens often… I’m not even sure myself. And about any secrets—honestly, I know nothing.”</p>

<p>Sani let out a flat hum.</p>

<p>“Ehh, so even his own girlfriend doesn’t know much about him, huh.”</p>

<p>Those words silenced Iri. She lowered her gaze, thoughts quietly spiraling.</p>

<p><i>She’s right… maybe up until now, I don’t actually know anything about him</i></p>

<p>Her pen hovered uselessly over the page, blank lines waiting for notes that never came. Sani noticed the silence beside her, raising a brow but saying nothing this time.</p>

<p>Hiki, meanwhile, sat slouched in his chair a few rows back, his eyes half-lidded, as though the entire world bored him. Yet even in that apathy, there was a strange weight that made people glance his way from time to time, as if they couldn’t help but wonder what was hiding beneath that detached expression.</p>

<p>Iri’s grip tightened around her pen. For the first time, she felt a flicker of unease—like there was a wall between them she hadn’t even noticed until now.</p>

<p>Without anyone realizing, the bell rang again—this time signaling the lunch break. The room instantly lit up with cheers of relief, the heavy air replaced by laughter and chatter. Desks screeched as students rushed to their friends, planning where to eat.</p>

<p>Iri’s gaze wandered toward the back of the room. Hiki was already on his feet, heading straight for the door without sparing a glance at anyone. His movements were deliberate, unhurried, but distant—as though the crowd around him didn’t even exist.</p>

<p>Sani leaned in, her elbow nudging Iri’s arm. A sly grin played on her lips.</p>

<p>“You two aren’t having lunch together?” she teased, her tone dripping with mischief.</p>

<p>Iri muttered under her breath, almost too quiet to hear.<br>
“He’s probably heading to the principal’s office… he said he doesn’t eat lunch.”</p>

<p>Her tone carried a trace of disappointment, the kind she didn’t bother to hide.</p>

<p>Sani caught it right away. Without missing a beat, she wrapped her arm around Iri’s shoulder and gave her a playful squeeze.<br>
“Then come with me,” she said brightly. “Let’s hit the cafeteria. My treat. I’ll even drag some friends from the other class to join us—it’ll be fun!”</p>

<p>The warmth in Sani’s voice was a stark contrast to the heavy thought lingering in Iri’s chest. Still, she managed a small smile, letting herself be pulled along.</p>
